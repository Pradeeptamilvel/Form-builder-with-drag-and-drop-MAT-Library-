# Dashboard Layout Implementation Plan

## Steps to Complete:

1. [x] Create Dashboard Component (`dashboard.component.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`)
2. [x] Update App Routing Module (`app-routing.module.ts`)
3. [ ] Update App Component (`app.component.html`)
4. [x] Update App Module (`app.module.ts`) - DashboardComponent declared
5. [ ] Test the implementation

## Current Progress:
- Dashboard component created with Bootstrap grid layout
- App routing module updated to use DashboardComponent
- App module updated with DashboardComponent declaration
- Bootstrap is already installed and configured
- All required components (form-elements, main-form, field-settings) already exist
- Authentication service and guard are in place

## Current Issue:
- DashboardComponent is being treated as standalone by Angular (investigating)

## Files to be created/updated:
- ~~`src/app/component/dashboard/dashboard.component.ts`~~ ✅
- ~~`src/app/component/dashboard/dashboard.component.html`~~ ✅
- ~~`src/app/component/dashboard/dashboard.component.scss`~~ ✅
- ~~`src/app/app-routing.module.ts`~~ ✅
- `src/app/app.component.html` (update to conditionally show dashboard)
- ~~`src/app/app.module.ts`~~ ✅ (DashboardComponent declared)

## Implementation Details:
- Dashboard uses Bootstrap grid layout: col-2, col-7, col-3
- Components arranged as requested: form-elements, main-form, field-settings
- Authentication flow will be maintained
